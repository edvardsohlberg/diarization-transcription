# Optional requirements for testing the Whisper scripts locally
# NOTE: Your system Python 3.13 already has all these packages installed from PyCharm CE
# Only install these if you want to use the virtual environment instead

# Core dependencies for testing
numpy>=1.21.0
librosa>=0.9.0
lxml>=4.6.0

# For mocking and testing
# Note: unittest.mock is part of Python standard library, no need to install

# Optional: for better audio handling
soundfile>=0.10.0

# Note: transformers, torch, and pyannote.audio are NOT included here
# as they would download the large models we want to avoid for testing
